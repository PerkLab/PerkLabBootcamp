-	Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/) if you bring a Windows computer. If you use another operating system, find a git client and get familiar with it (know how to clone a repository and push your changes).

-	Install latest version of PLUS from: http://perk-software.cs.queensu.ca/plus/packages/nightly/ -> PlusApp-...-Win32.exe package (the generic version, not Ultrasonix, Telemed, etc.).

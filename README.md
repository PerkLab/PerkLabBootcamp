# Joint global workshop on Sustainable Development in Computer-Assisted Interventions and Diagnosis

![](banner.jpg)

The aim of this workshop, delivered as an intense three day bootcamp, is to provide training for engineering and computing students for best practices for prototyping of medical image computing, computer-assisted interventions and artificial intelligence applications in an open-source software environment. The workshop is also offered in support of Train the Trainers program that is established to develop sustainable technology development in medical interventions. It will be an online training event, offered by scientists and software engineers in Canada (Queen’s University, Carlton University, National Research Council), Spain (University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria) and Senegal (Cheikh Anta Diop University, Ecole Supérieure Polytechnique).
 
Train the Trainer is an alliance of several institutions including Queen’s University, University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Harvard Medical School, and several collaborators in West Africa particularly in Senegal and Mauritania, that is founded on the premise of innovative applications of free open-source software. The program supports a free, open-source medical image analysis and visualization software ecosystem [3D Slicer](http://www.slicer.org), downloaded over 1,000,000 times across the globe since its inception over 20 years ago. Sustainable development is based on free open source software, knowledge translation and closing the knowledge gap between historically privileged academic centres and those in low and middle income countries. 

## Logistics

- Date:	2022 May 24-26

## Pre-requisites

These were the pre-requisites for last year. This year they may be slightly different. Please check them again in a few days.

- Install [3D Slicer](http://download.slicer.org/) latest stable version (4.11.20210226) -> nightly 64-bit installer. After you installed Slicer, start it, open the Extension manager, and install these extensions: SlicerIGT, SlicerOpenIGTLink, DebuggingTools, SlicerElastix, SegmentRegistration, TCIABrowser, SlicerDMRI, SlicerJupyter.
- Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/) if you have a Windows computer. On macOS and Linux, Git client is usually already installed by default. If you are not comfortable with using softare via the terminal then install a Git client with a graphical user interface, such as [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
- [VisualStudio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Install the Python extension from Microsoft (ms-python.python).
- Register a user at www.github.com
- If you want to effectively participate in day 3: get familiar with Python and numpy syntax; spend some time to get to know VTK (read as much of the [VTK textbook](https://vtk.org/vtk-textbook/) as you can, try to run some of the [VTK examples](https://kitware.github.io/vtk-examples/site/) in Python) and learn about [Qt for Python](https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python) (for example, complete a few basic tutorials).
- Only for students at Queen's: Prepare with a short introduction about yourself (2-3 minutes, supported by 1-2 slides): experience, research interests, something personal
- Install zoom and familiarize yourself with [SpatialChat](https://spatial.chat/s/TryMe) (we will use it for hands-on sessions so that multiple participant can share screen and ask questions from instructors when they get stuck)
- Windows users: Download and install latest stable 64-Bit Plus (2.8.0.20191105-Win64) from [here](http://perk-software.cs.queensu.ca/plus/packages/stable/).
- Windows users: Print a set of ArUco markers from [here](https://github.com/PlusToolkit/PlusLibData/raw/master/ConfigFiles/OpticalMarkerTracker/marker_sheet_36h12.pdf) at 100% scale.
- Download NeuroNav tutorial data from (link will be posted soon).

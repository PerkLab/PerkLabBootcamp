-	Bring your own laptop. Windows OS is strongly recommended.
-	Install [3D Slicer](http://download.slicer.org/) latest stable version -> nightly 64-bit installer. After you installed Slicer, start it, open the Extension manager, and install these extensions: SlicerIGT, Sequences, Debugging tools
-	Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/) if you bring a Windows computer. If you use another operating system, find a git client and get familiar with it (know how to clone a repository and push your changes).
-	[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) Professional Edition (you can activate it immediately with your university email address), Community version is not suitable (does not support remote debugging) 
-	Install latest version of PLUS from: http://perk-software.cs.queensu.ca/plus/packages/nightly/ -> PlusApp-...-Win32.exe package (the generic version, not Ultrasonix, Telemed, etc.). If you bring a non-Windows computer then you may not be able to follow certain hands-on exercises (less than 2 hours in total).
